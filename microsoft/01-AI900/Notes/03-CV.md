# Exam AI-900 : Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals

## Describe features of Computer Vision workloads on Azure

---

### 1. Identify common types of Computer Vision solution

**Computer vision Solutions cover different topic :**
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Semantic segmentation
- Image analysis
- Face detection, analysis and recognition
- Optical character recognition (OCR)

### 2. Identify Azure tools and services for Computer Vision tasks

Different services are provided by Azure to help at specific tasks :

| Service         | Purpose                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Computer Vision | use this service to analyze images and video and extract descriptions, tags, objects and text           |
| Custom Vision   | use this service to train custom image classifciation and object detection models using your own images |
| Face            | use this service to build face detection and facial recognition solutions                               |
| Form Recognizer | use this service to extract information from scanned forms and invoices                                 |


#### Computer Vision
- Tags that could be used to index an image
- Categorize an image
- Identify objects in an image
- Detect faces and people in an image
- Recognize landmarks and celebrities
- Read text in an image
  - OCR (recognize individual shapes as leetters, numerals, punct, or other element)
  - MCR (semantic model to interpret the text is about)

**OCR API**
- for small amount of text in images
- work sync
- info return
  - regions
  - lines
  - words

**READ API**
- scan doc with a lot of text
- work async
- info returns 
  - pages
  - lines
  - words

#### Custom vision
- image classification
- object detection (return coordinate where label can be found)
- eval
  - average precision
  - precision
  - recall

#### Face
- face detection
- face verif
- find similar face
- group face based on similarities
- identify people
- face detection attributes
  - face emotion
  - makeup detect return bool true or false
- image for most accurate recognizition
  - JPEG, OPPNG, GIF, BLP
  - 6 MB max
  - great light
  - avoid noise

#### Recognizer
- model support a prebuilt receipt model
- custom model
- format 
  - less 50mb
  - 50 x 50 px
- info
  - time
  - date
  - receipt 
  - taxes
  - etc...
