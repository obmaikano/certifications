# Exam AI-900 : Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals

## Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure

---

Machine Learning on Azure contains several services but if we divide we find these :
- Azure Machine Learning
- Cognitive Services (you'll see later on [computer-vision](03-CV.md) and [nlp](04-NLP.md) parts)
- Azure Bot Service (you'll see later on [conversational-AI](05-CONVERSATIONAL.md))

### 1. Identify common machine learning types

| Type of Learning       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supervised learning    | In supervised learning, algorithms make predictions based on a set of labeled examples that you provide. This technique is useful when you know what the outcome should look like.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Unsupervised learning  | In unsupervised learning, the data points aren’t labeled the algorithm labels them for you by organizing the data or describing its structure. This technique is useful when you don’t know what the outcome should look like.                                                                                                                                        |
| Reinforcement learning | Reinforcement learning uses algorithms that learn from outcomes and decide which action to take next. After each action, the algorithm receives feedback that helps it determine whether the choice it made was correct, neutral, or incorrect. It’s a good technique to use for automated systems that have to make a lot of small decisions without human guidance. |

| Purpose of Algorithms | Algorithms Types | Definition                                                                                       | Example                                                    |
|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Predict values        | Regression       | Predict the value of a new data point based on historical data.                                  | How many patients will come through the clinic on Tuesday? |
| Classification        | Classification   | Predictive calculations to assign data to preset categories.                                     | Is this email spam?                                        |
| Discover similarities | Clustering       | Divide the data into multiple groups by determining the level of similarity between data points. | Which viewers like the same types of movies?               |


### 2. Describe core machine learning concepts

| Algorithms Types | Name                               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| regression       | Mean absolute error (MAE)          | measures how close the predictions are to the actual outcomes; thus, a lower score is better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| regression       | Root mean squared error (RMSE)     | creates a single value that summarizes the error in the model. By squaring the difference, the metric disregards the difference between over-prediction and under-prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| regression       | Relative absolute error (RAE)      | is the relative absolute difference between expected and actual values; relative because the mean difference is divided by the arithmetic mean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| regression       | Relative squared error (RSE)       | similarly normalizes the total squared error of the predicted values by dividing by the total squared error of the actual values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| regression       | Coefficient of determination (R2)  | represents the predictive power of the model as a value between 0 and 1. Zero means the model is random (explains nothing); 1 means there is a perfect fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| classification   | Accuracy                           | measures the goodness of a classification model as the proportion of true results to total cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| classification   | Precision                          | is the proportion of true results over all positive results. Precision = TP/(TP+FP)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| classification   | Recall                             | is the fraction of the total amount of relevant instances that were actually retrieved. Recall = TP/(TP+FN)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| classification   | F1-Score                           | is computed as the weighted average of precision and recall between 0 and 1, where the ideal F1 score value is 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| classification   | AUC                                | measures the area under the curve plotted with true positives on the y axis and false positives on the x axis. This metric is useful because it provides a single number that lets you compare models of different types. AUC is classification-threshold-invariant. It measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen. |
| clustering       | Average Distance to Other Center   | represent how close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroids of all other clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| clustering       | Average Distance to Cluster Center | represent the closeness of all points in a cluster to the centroid of that cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| clustering       | Number of Points                   | shows how many data points were assigned to each cluster, along with the total overall number of data points in any cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| clustering       | Maximal Distance to Cluster Center | represent the max of the distances between each point and the centroid of that point's cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| clustering       | Combined Evaluation                | score at the bottom of each section of results lists the averaged scores for the clusters created in that particular model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
